# Core Framework (CF) #
## Version 1.0.4,(~5kb, Minified and GZipped) ##

Lightweight JavaScript library based on jQuery to solve essential key points in JavaScript development, JavaScript OOP applications and User Interface (UI) development

  * CF's goal is to simplify and standardize the following essential aspects of JavaScript programming:
    * JavaScript Namespaces
    * JavaScript Class Definition
    * Class Inheritance in JavaScript
    * Delegates
    * Mixins
    * Autoloading
    * Preloading
    * SVG/VML bridge
  * Optimization, balance, reuse
    * Core Framework is designed to provide functionality using minimum set of resources. By providing relatively small core combined with mechanism for loading resources on demand, Core Framework can reduce load & execution time of your scripts.


  * Open Source
    * CF is an open source project developed and maintained by Angel Kostadinov (http://angeneer.com - Advanced Engineering). Feel free to use it in open source and/or commercial projects.
