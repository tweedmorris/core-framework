# Introduction #

A robust, cross-browser and easy-to-use dialog based on jQuery and Core Framework. The script allows for easy implementation of animated dialogs allowing for dynamic resize in both X and Y directions.

The dialog supports callbacks and can be easily transformed into dynamic object loading it's content via AJAX for instance.

We'll appreciate comments/suggestions/bug reports etc.
